# Firewave Hosting - RPC 
A nice little Discord Rich Presence Client for **Firewave Hosting**. Literally just an advertisement. 
 
## What is Firewave Hosting? 
Well, I'm glad you asked...  
Firewave Hosting is a Hosting Service I(@Atlas7005) have started. Firewave has not yet launched and are pending funding (if you wish to help, read [this](#funding)).  
But when we do launch, we're gonna be a Game Server, VPS, and Web Hosting service with high speed servers, 24/7 uptime, and amazing support.
